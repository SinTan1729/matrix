# `matrix-basic`

### A Rust crate for very basic matrix operations.

This is a crate for very basic matrix operations with any type that supports addition, substraction, multiplication,
negation, has a zero defined, and implements the Copy trait. Additional properties (e.g. division, existence of one etc.)
might be needed for certain operations.

I created it mostly to learn how to use generic types and traits.

## Usage
Documentation is available here: [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/matrix-basic).
